# BigOrder

BigOrder is a simple tool that can be used to order objects in a manner of best to worst using user inputs. BigOrder has arisen from the innate difficulty of comparing and ranking a large set of items. With the rise of tier lists, ordering and sorting into ordered categories has become a huge part of internet culture, and in-person discussions as a whole. With that in mind, BigOrder was conceived as a way to remove the complexity from the ranking process.
